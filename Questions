ðŸ§© Requirement Stage
- Engages stakeholders to define functional needs (e.g. patient management, consultations, wearable integration).
- Identifies non-functional requirements like scalability, security, and compliance (HIPAA/GDPR).
- Flags early risks such as data ownership and integration complexity.
ðŸ§ª Design Stage
- Selects the architectural style (microservices + event-driven).
- Defines service boundaries, data flow, and API contracts.
- Plans for modularity, fault tolerance, and future scalability.
ðŸš€ Deployment Stage
- Designs CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes).
- Implements monitoring, logging, and rollback strategies.
- Ensures secure deployment and performance tuning.

 Risk/Concern: Data Ownership Ambiguity
- Context: Wearables collect sensitive health data (e.g., heart rate, steps).
- Architectâ€™s Responsibility: Clarify who owns and controls this data â€” the user, the device vendor, or the healthcare platform â€” to avoid legal, ethical, and compliance issues (especially under HIPAA/GDPR).
This concern is mapped directly to the Requirement Stage of the SDLC, showing thoughtful anticipation of real-world challenges. Additional risks like operational complexity in microservices and latency in real-time alerts are also discussed in later stages. So yes, the assignment meets this rubric criterion with clarity and relevance.


ðŸ§  Hybrid Architecture: Microservices + Layered + Data-Driven
âœ… 1. Microservices Architecture
- Each core feature is built as an independent service:
- Patient Management Service
- Consultation Service (video/chat)
- Wearable Integration Service
- AI Recommendation Service
- Auth & Notification Services
- Benefits: Scalability, fault isolation, parallel development

âœ… 2. Layered Architecture (Inside Each Microservice)
Each microservice follows a clean internal structure:
- Presentation Layer: API endpoints or UI adapters
- Business Logic Layer: Core processing and rules
- Data Access Layer: Interfaces with databases or external APIs
- Benefits: Separation of concerns, maintainability, testability

âœ… 3. Data-Driven Architecture
- The system is designed around data flow and intelligence:
- Wearables stream biometric data â†’ stored in time-series DB
- AI engine consumes historical + real-time data â†’ generates insights
- Patient records and consultation logs feed into analytics dashboards
- Benefits: Real-time decision-making, personalized recommendations, predictive alerts
