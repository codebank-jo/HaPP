🩺 Slide 1: Title Slide
- Title: System Design for Healthcare Application with Wearable Integration
- Subtitle: Patient Management, Online Consultation, AI Recommendations
- Presented by: 
- Date: September 2025

🧠 Slide 2: Project Overview
- Objective: Build a scalable healthcare app integrating patient services, consultations, AI insights, and wearable data.
- Key Features:
- Patient Management
- Video & Chat Consultations
- AI-Driven Health Recommendations
- Wearable Device Integration

🛠️ Slide 3: Architect’s Role in SDLC
|Stage  | Responsibilities | 
| Requirement | Define use cases, compliance, integration points | 
| Design | Choose architecture, define services, plan scalability  | 
| Deployment| CI/CD setup, monitoring, rollback strategies | 
- Risk: Data ownership ambiguity with wearables

🧱 Slide 4: Architectural Pattern Choice
- Chosen Style: Microservices Architecture + Event-Driven Extensions
- Why Microservices?
- Modular development
- Scalability
- Fault isolation
- Easier integration with wearables and AI modules

📌 Slide 5: Justification
Functional Requirements
- Patient records → isolated service
- Consultations → dedicated video/chat service
- AI recommendations → separate inference engine
- Wearables → device-specific microservices
Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability, security, performance, maintainability
Constraints
- Budget-conscious scaling
- Fast time-to-market
- Common developer skill sets (e.g., FastAPI, Docker)

⚖️ Slide 6: Trade-Offs
- Limitation: Operational complexity
- Requires service discovery, monitoring, and orchestration tools
- DevOps maturity needed for smooth deployment

🧩 Slide 7: System Components
- Database Layer: Patient records, consultation logs, wearable metrics
- Application Layer: Microservices for each feature
- Interaction Layer: Mobile/web UI, chat, video call interface
- Wearable Integration: APIs for Fitbit, Apple HealthKit, Google Fit
- AI Engine: Health insights based on biometric and historical data

🔐 Slide 8: Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Security: OAuth2 + JWT, RBAC, encrypted data flow
- Privacy: Data minimization, user consent, anonymization for analytics

🚀 Slide 9: Next Steps
- Build service diagrams
- Define API contracts
- Prototype wearable ingestion pipeline
- Validate AI recommendation logic
